Added
^^^^^

* Support for structured JSON logging.
  (`#35 <https://github.com/jgosmann/dmarc-metrics-exporter/issues/35>`_)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Logs are colored by default.
* It is no longer possible to override the following keys in the logging
  configuration: ``version``, ``incremental``, ``formatters``.
* ``root.handlers`` will be set to ``['default']`` in the logging configuration
  if not provided explicitly.

  matter what might be configured in the logging configuration.

---------------------

Added
^^^^^

* `dmarc_invalid_reports_total` metric with a count of emails from which no
  DMARC report could be parsed.

  (use last non null value instead of mean over range).

This release exclusively updates dependencies in use.


[0.9.3] - 2023-07-25

[0.9.1] - 2023-02-09
--------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fix problems with large emails that would either cause the whole program to
  crash or prevent the processing of any new emails. This was solved by
  updating the bite-parser dependency to at least version 0.2.2.
  (`#34 <https://github.com/jgosmann/dmarc-metrics-exporter/issues/34>`_,
  `bite-parser v0.2.2 <https://github.com/jgosmann/bite-parser/releases/tag/v0.2.2>`_)

^^^^^

* Officially declare Python 3.11 support.

  [as ``-`` is no longer allowed in role
  names](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/creating_role.html#role-names).
* ``dmarc_metrics_exporter_virtualenv_path`` variable has been added
* The Ansible role no longer creates a system user. Instead the systemd
  "DynamicUser" feature is used.

[0.5.0] - 2022-02-09

[0.4.1] - 2021-11-13
--------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Fixed the changelog markup so that it renders correctly.
* Fixes of the deployment pipelines.


[0.4.0] - 2021-11-13
--------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``metrics_db`` configuration option has been replaced with the
  ``storage_path`` configuration option. To migrate your existing setup:

  1. Ensure that your ``metrics_db`` file is called ``metrics.db``.
  2. Ensure that the directory containing the `metrics.db` file is writable by
     the dmarc-metrics-exporter.
  2. Remove the ``metrics_db`` setting from the configuration file.
  3. Add a new ``storage_path`` setting pointing to the directory containing the
     ``metrics.db`` file.

* Disabled the access log. It clutters the log output with barely relevant
  messages (there is only a single page being served and it will be polled
  regularly by Prometheus).

Added
^^^^^

* Support for reports sent in gzip format.
* A log message will be produced for emails from which no report could be
  extracted.
* Duplicate reports will now only be counted once. The duration for which report
  IDs are stored to detect duplicates can be configured with the
  ``deduplication_max_seconds`` configuration setting. The default is one week.
* Added a Dockerfile to the repository to build a Docker image with
  dmarc-metrics-exporter. `Images for official releases will be published on
  Docker Hub. <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jgosmann/dmarc-metrics-exporter>`_
* Support for Python 3.9.


[0.3.0] - 2021-03-01
--------------------

^^^^^^^

* Change default port to 9797 which does to collide with other Prometheus
  exporter.


[0.2.3] - 2021-01-11
--------------------

Fixed
^^^^^

* Change the repository link to the correct repository (e.g. on PyPI)


[0.2.2] - 2020-12-31
--------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Ansible role for deployment.


[0.2.1] - 2020-12-31
