[0.4.0] - 2021-11-13
--------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``metrics_db`` configuration option has been replaced with the
  ``storage_path`` configuration option. To migrate your existing setup:

  1. Ensure that your ``metrics_db`` file is called ``metrics.db``.
  2. Ensure that the directory containing the `metrics.db` file is writable by
     the dmarc-metrics-exporter.
  2. Remove the ``metrics_db`` setting from the configuration file.
  3. Add a new ``storage_path`` setting pointing to the directory containing the
     ``metrics.db`` file.

* Disabled the access log. It clutters the log output with barely relevant
  messages (there is only a single page being served and it will be polled
  regularly by Prometheus).

Added
^^^^^

* Support for reports sent in gzip format.
* A log message will be produced for emails from which no report could be
  extracted.
* Duplicate reports will now only be counted once. The duration for which report
  IDs are stored to detect duplicates can be configured with the
  ``deduplication_max_seconds`` configuration setting. The default is one week.
* Added a Dockerfile to the repository to build a Docker image with
  dmarc-metrics-exporter. `Images for official releases will be published on
  Docker Hub. <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jgosmann/dmarc-metrics-exporter>`_
* Support for Python 3.9.
